## introduction 
### sampling an analog signal is a crucial step for any digital signal processing system 
## description 
### it is a web application that illustrates the signal sampling and recovery showing the importance and validation of the nyquist rate
### Our application have the following features:
#### >-visualize and sample a signal and use the sampled points to recover the original signal
#### >-prepare mixed signal by adding sinusoidal signals with different frequancy and magnitudes 
#### >-remove any component from the mixed signal
#### >-adding noise to the loaded signal 
#### >-resize the signals without missing the UI
## technology used 
### python with streamlit
